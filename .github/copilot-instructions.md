# JS Best Practices

## Code Standards and Conventions

Always utilize the latest Node.js and JavaScript features in strict mode. Embrace modern practices and current design patterns. Prefer semantic HTML elements (header, nav, main, section, article, footer) over generic divs.

## Patterns and Best Practices

Apply functional programming principles: immutability, pure functions, and avoiding uncontrolled side effects.

## Coding Style and Documentation

Comment on the "why" rather than the "how" and use JSDoc/TSDoc to document interfaces, types, and complex functions. Structure commits according to the Conventional Commits convention (feat, fix, chore, docs, refactor). Maintain clear and up-to-date README files for each important module, documenting its purpose, usage, and dependencies.
